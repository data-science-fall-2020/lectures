# TODO

- ~~Modify [git notes](./01_git/01_git_github.Rmd) to~~:
	1. ~~Initiate repos on GitHub rather than locally. This seems more intuitive for students than linking the repos manually.~~
	2. ~~Remove all instances of forking. Just getting them to clone and push I think is enough.~~
	
	I decided that initiating on local is better for generalizability (not every project is on GitHub). Instead of removing forking, I added branching. This will make group projects run smoother.
